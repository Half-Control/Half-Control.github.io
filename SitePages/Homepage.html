                        I did not do a lot of VR work, but I made a simple enemy that moves using a nav agent and nav mesh. I also used my group mate Tom's code in another project as reference for the attacks.

                        As the player character programmer, I'm tasked to sync the player through the network. But as of now, it has proved to be harder than expected. The only other thing I've networked has been a really simple character, found in the gif to the right.

                        This week I helped get a networked connection up between two clients over LAN! There were some difficulties we encountered such as finding out two Unity editors cannot connect to LAN, at least one has to be from a build. With a LAN Connection setup, now I can start working on the fun stuff: passing data over that connection!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Aside from networking I also got a base UI setup working with a Restart/Quit menu for singleplayer and a multiplayer menu containing LAN or Online Host/Join options! One of the hurdles I had to cover this week with UI having the player being able to interact with it. That was solved by using a RayCast when the player pressed the right trigger on the UI. This also helped me to incorporate some feedback to the player with some hover and confirm sound effects.

                        This project is a VR dungeon crawling game that you can play with friends. I have been tasked with creating enemies and handling procedural animation.

                        Recently I've been working on learning procedural animations using <a href="https://lnkd.in/eX5mqzqX">this</a> tutorial. I have succeeded in the math behind head tracking as well as eye tracking, and I've started working on understanding the math behind inverse kinematics.

                        I am working on the procedural generation of the dungeon for our project. I am tasked with implementing the Bowyer Watson algorithm to connect randomly placed rooms with both hallways and staircases

                    <p>
                        So far I am just placing rooms (currently just cubes of varying size) randomly and successfully got them to place without overlapping with each other. Next step is to establish the connections which will turn into our hallways!

                        I am the team lead as well as the player gameplay programmer. Here's what I've been doing on the project so far!

                    <p>
                        I've been working on setting up basic VR movement using a custom collide and slide algorithm for collision detection and movement. The gif shows the algorithm hitting the geometry and sliding the movement along the wall-normal. There is some dampening with the angle hitting the wall. That way, moving directly into a wall will fully cancel the movement.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The second image shows the player character that I made. The player character is hooked up with VR capabilities, the basic setup was to have player movement, hand movement, and camera rotations.
