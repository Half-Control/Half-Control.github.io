                        This project is a VR dungeon crawling game that you can play with friends. I have been tasked with creating enemies and handling procedural animation.

                        Recently I've been working on learning procedural animations using <a href="https://lnkd.in/eX5mqzqX">this</a> tutorial. I have succeeded in the math behind head tracking as well as eye tracking, and I've started working on understanding the math behind inverse kinematics.

                        I am working on the procedural generation of the dungeon for our project. I am tasked with implementing the Bowyer Watson algorithm to connect randomly placed rooms with both hallways and staircases
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So far I am just placing rooms (currently just cubes of varying size) randomly and successfully got them to place without overlapping with each other. Next step is to establish the connections which will turn into our hallways!

                        I am the team lead as well as the player gameplay programmer. Here's what I've been doing on the project so far!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I've been working on setting up basic VR movement using a custom collide and slide algorithm for collision detection and movement. The gif shows the algorithm hitting the geometry and sliding the movement along the wall-normal. There is some dampening with the angle hitting the wall. That way, moving directly into a wall will fully cancel the movement.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The second image shows the player character that I made. The player character is hooked up with VR capabilities, the basic setup was to have player movement, hand movement, and camera rotations.

                        I am the Networking/UI Programmer on the team working on developing systems to help connect multiple clients online! We are developing our project with Unity using the XR All In One SDK and Unity's Netcode for Game Objects, Unity Relay, and Unity Lobby APIs to develop the game.

                        I have currently developed an In-Game Debug Console to help assist us when debugging outside the editor and when we run into errors. I have also connected multiple clients with LAN and WAN options!
